                <p>
                  I am a student at the University of Toronto, where I study <a class="home-link" href="https://www.mie.utoronto.ca/" target="_blank">Industrial Engineering</a>. I have a keen interest in business and technology. Specificially, I am intrigued by the power sofware has to improve a business as a whole.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I believe that in many ways, technology has fundamentally changed how we interact with the world but sometimes this change has not been optimal for people. I am a huge believer in human centred design, and aspire to put humans first in everything I build.

                  This webpage serves as a living document of some of the things that I have done; a portfolio. As such, it is a perpetual work in progress!

            <p class="text">
              I added visual elements to the Onyx Motion Website to help convey some of the applications of Swish, Onyx Motion's sports coaching app for wearables.

            <p class="text">
              When working on the site, a major challenge that I had was learning how to use jQuery to modify video elements in a webpage. I had no prior experience with it and had to spend a great deal of time understanding its syntax and how I could levrage it for the site.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another challenge I had was ensuring that everything is correctly aligned on the site. By struggling to understand the powerful row and column system given by Bootstrap, I was able to create a beautiful, well-aligned section of the site. And, this experience has enabled me to do well in future projects such as my portfolio (which is what you are reading right now).

            <p>
              As a part of my class on the the Fundamentals of Object Oriented Programming (MIE 250), I created a program to help assign students to high schools. The program had to account for GPA, extra curriculars and student preference to assign them to schools.
            </p>
            <p>
              This program implemented the Gale-Shapely algorithm, which is suitor optimal. In my implementation of the Gale-Shapely algorithm, the students were the suitors and the schools were the recievers. I applied various optimizations to ensure algorithm efficiency. In the end, My algorithm was able to make 2000 matches in less than 750ms.

            <br>
            <p class="text">
              The Canadian-Muslim Vote is a national, non-partisan, educational organization whose aim is to increase Muslim civic engagement. I led the redesign of the two main educational sections of the Canadian-Muslim Vote's website, incorporating various elements such as videos and images.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              The educational content within the site was very text heavy, and I realized early on that I had to do things to add to the readability of the text. So, I decided to do the following:
            </p>
              <ul class="text">
                <li>
                  Highlight important text using <span class="red">color</span><!--  (see Post Election Results Section) -->
                </li>
                <li>
                  Visually arange text into readable chunks <!-- (see Speech from the Throne Section) -->
                </li>
                <li>
                  Hide text (when possible) and give users the power to toggle hidden text <!-- (see MP Mandate Letters Section) -->
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                All of these design features helped make the new sections informative and readable.
